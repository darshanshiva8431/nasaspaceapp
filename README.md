# 1. Project Title 
## *GHG Insight*   
# 2. Project Description 
###    An Introduction to GreenHouse gases (GHG):
##### * *Heat trap*:  
   Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to **global warming**.
##### * *Environmental impact*: 
   Affects ecosystems, climate and human health.
### Importance of management: 
_Important for **individuals, companies** and authorities committed to sustainability.
#### Definition of Greenhouse Gases:
**greenhouse gases**: include **carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrogen oxides (N2O) and gases containing fluorine**.
### Emission sources:
 - Combustion of fossil fuels for energy
 - Industrial processes
 - Agricultural practices
 - Waste management
 - Types of greenhouse gas calculators
1. **Individual check**:
-for buildings to estimate greenhouse gas emissions.
Prepare recommendations for life changes.
2. **Business analyst**:
-Helps companies assess emissions from operations and supply chains.
Focus on the confirmation frame.
3. **Support Sectors**:
-Good for industries like **agriculture, construction and transportation**.
4. **National and Regional Guidelines**:
-Used by government and non-governmental organizations for policy development and compliance.
### Conclusion:
1. **Combining knowledge and action** :  **GHG calculations** allow users to **reduce** their **carbon footprint**.
2. **sustainability Guide**:  Essential tools to guide sustainability efforts in all areas.
3. **Collective Action**:  **Mobilize people** and organizations to **control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions** for a better planet.
